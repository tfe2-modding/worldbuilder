- fixed a bug where building islands far down would make it impossible to build floating platforms near them
- added computer alien ruins from the hackers scenario to the world resources menu
- added a button in the new city menu to create a city with no worlds and no objectives
- added several flags and settings to the export scenario window
- redrew all the icons to fit the vanilla game better
- clicking on an island type in the build menu that you already had selected now deselects it to match with the rest of the game
